# Morse Code Code Plus

Turing-complete and hyper-minimalist language

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Abstract:

Do you enjoy abstract suffering? Then this langauge is just ripe for you!
Back in my days people had to right code in machine code. The only real pure form of code. Langauges like BF are too bloated.
The great Machine God would be displeased. Other more hertical even suggest of thing like Assembly, which is basically turning code into toy building blocks.
Code is not a tool, it is a gift of the machine code. Some hertical wizards even deal in C, playing with dealy hanging pointors and memory courption. 
While other stright up hertics in python, are spoon feed by the python virtual machines. They along with the others of their kindling are all in needed of the 
saving grace of Morse Code Code Plus. And a return to the roots of the real orignal internet, morse code.

- Btw this is a satire langauge for those of you who don't get it. Have fun coding! 

Morse Code Code Plus was written on arch without a desktop in vim, the way it was ment to be. Now the problem with BF is that 8 chars in the synatx is too much
we need only 3. With three we can still remain turing-competete. It all runs on the only super-high-level langauge accepted by the Machine God, Rust. 
Morse Code

# How Morse Code Code Plus works?

- The compiler it is written in Rust, and parses thourgh a file, with the file extension mccp. In which asci code text is written, in either of the characters below.
- `.`, `-`, and ` `
- Instead of having 8 set in stone actions based on characters, and only effecting repetions, Morse Code Code Plus is trully free with the usage of whitespace.

# BASICS

The whole concept behind `Morse Code Code Plus` is memory manipulation. Just like BF, but you are given this time, a pointer sized array, just like `vec` from rust. Within this special array, blessed by the Machine God, one can increase the memory pointer, increase the value at the memory pointer, etc. So without futher to do these are the man operators available.
